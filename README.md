------
**Anthropic Laravel** is a community-maintained PHP API client that allows you to interact with the [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/intro-to-claude). This package is based on the excellent work of [Nuno Maduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro) and [Sandro Gehri](https://github.com/gehrisandro).

> **Note:** This repository contains the integration code of the **Anthropic PHP** for Laravel. If you want to use the **Anthropic PHP** client in a framework-agnostic way, take a look at the [mozex/anthropic-php](https://github.com/mozex/anthropic-php) repository.

Thank you for considering sponsoring. Your support truly makes a difference!

## Get Started

> **Requires [PHP 8.1+](https://php.net/releases/)**

First, install Anthropic via the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager:

```bash
composer require mozex/anthropic-laravel
```

Next, execute the install command:

```bash
php artisan anthropic:install
```

This will create a `config/anthropic.php` configuration file in your project, which you can modify to your needs
using environment variables.
Blank environment variable for the Anthropic API key is already appended to your `.env` file.

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Finally, you may use the `Anthropic` facade to access the Anthropic API:

```php
use Anthropic\Laravel\Facades\Anthropic;

$result = Anthropic::messages()->create([
    'model' => 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
    'max_tokens' => 1024,
    'messages' => [
        ['role' => 'user', 'content' => 'Hello!'],
    ],
]);

echo $result->content[0]->text; // Hello! How can I assist you today?
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done via environment variables or directly in the configuration file (`config/anthropic.php`).

### Anthropic API Key

Specify your Anthropic API Key. This will be used to authenticate with the Anthropic API - you can find your API key on your Anthropic dashboard, at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys.

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```

### Request Timeout

The timeout may be used to specify the maximum number of seconds to wait
for a response. By default, the client will time out after 30 seconds.

```env
ANTHROPIC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=
```

## Usage

For usage examples, take a look at the [mozex/anthropic-php](https://github.com/mozex/anthropic-php) repository.

## Testing

The `Anthropic` facade comes with a `fake()` method that allows you to fake the API responses.

The fake responses are returned in the order they are provided to the `fake()` method.

All responses are having a `fake()` method that allows you to easily create a response object by only providing the parameters relevant for your test case.

```php
use Anthropic\Laravel\Facades\Anthropic;
use Anthropic\Responses\Completions\CreateResponse;

Anthropic::fake([
    CreateResponse::fake([
        'completion' => 'awesome!',
    ]),
]);

$completion = Anthropic::completions()->create([
    'model' => 'claude-2.1',
    'prompt' => '\n\nHuman: PHP is \n\nAssistant:',
    'max_tokens_to_sample' => 100,
]);

expect($completion['completion'])->toBe('awesome!');
```

After the requests have been sent there are various methods to ensure that the expected requests were sent:

```php
// assert completion create request was sent
Anthropic::assertSent(Completions::class, function (string $method, array $parameters): bool {
    return $method === 'create' &&
        $parameters['model'] === 'claude-2.1' &&
        $parameters['prompt'] === 'PHP is ';
});
```

For more testing examples, take a look at the [mozex/anthropic-php](https://github.com/mozex/anthropic-php#testing) repository.
